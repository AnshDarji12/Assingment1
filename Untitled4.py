# # Why and when to use while loop in python give a detail description with example.

# In[43]:


#Python While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
#And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.
#While loop falls under the category of indefinite iteration. Indefinite iteration means that the number 
#of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance. 
#Statements represent all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming 
#construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of 
#grouping statements. When a while loop is executed, expr is first evaluated in a Boolean context and if 
#it is true, the loop body is executed. Then the expr is checked again, if it is still true then the body 
#is executed again and this continues until the expression becomes false.


# # Use nested while loop to print 3 different pattern.

# In[44]:


i=1
while i<=5:
    j=1
    while j<=i:
        print(j,end=" ")
        j=j+1
    print("")
    i=i+1 


# In[60]:


i=1  
while i<=5:
    j=1
    while j<=i:
        print(j,end="*")
        j=j+1
    print("*")
    i=i+1


# # Reverse a while loop to display numbers 10 to 1.

# In[61]:


i = 10
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i = i - 1
